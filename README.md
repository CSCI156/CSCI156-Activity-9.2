### Writing/Reading from a file part 2

##### Chapter 9 part 2
Redo chapter 9 part 1 so that:

1. Write a procedure that has your while loop from 9.1 in it. Pass the file to this procedure as a parameter instead of opening the file in the procedure. Eliminate the counter, that wonâ€™t be needed.
2. Write a new procedure that prints the contents of the file in upper case. Use a for loop that loops over the file to do this. Pass the file to this procedure as a parameter.
