### Writing/Reading from a file part 2

##### Chapter 9 part 1
You should already have this done:

1. Write a while loop that only exits when a user enters q (or Q). Otherwise write the users input to a file user.txt.

2. Rewrite your loop to count how many lines the use inputs. Use the count to print out the contents of the file – the count 
will tell you how many readlines() you need.

#### Chapter 9 part 2
Redo chapter 9 part 1 so that:

1. There is a procedure that executes the while loop. Pass the file to this procedure as a parameter. Eliminate the counter, 
that won’t be needed.
2. Write a new procedure that prints the contents of the file in upper case. Use a for loop to do this. Pass the file to 
this procedure as a parameter.
